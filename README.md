Assignment #01

Problem #01 (21 points – each requirement is 3 points)
1- The communication links are divided into two categories guided and
unguided media. Compare the two categories in terms of definition, speed,
advantages, and disadvantages. In addition, list examples of media for each
category.
2- Describe the two most popular wireless Internet access technologies
today. Compare them.
3- Discuss why mobile access networks have lower reliability than other
access networks.
4- Discuss the limitations of using coaxial cable for establishing a network.
5- What is the primary purpose of packet switching devices, and how do
switches and routers differ.
6- Packets can be lost due to the packet switching device’s buffer is full due to
long queuing time. Discuss the different reasons for long queuing time in
packet switching device.
7- What is the main advantage of packet switching over circuit switching.

Problem #02 (10 points – each requirement 5 points)

Consider a network where a sender wants to transmit a file of size 10,000
kilobits to a receiver connected direct to sender. The network link between
them has a transmission rate of 1 Mbps (megabits per second) and a
propagation delay of 10 milliseconds. Assume that the sender divides the
file into packets of 1 kilobit each. For more reliable transfer
acknowledgment (ACK) packet can be used after receiving each packet.
a) Calculate the total time taken to transmit the file from the sender to the
receiver, assuming there is no processing delay and without ACK.
b) Now, suppose an (ACK) packet of 100 bits is required for each transmitted
packet. Calculate the total time taken to transmit the file, including the ACK
packets, assuming there is no processing delay.

Problem #03 (10 points – each requirement 5 points)
A network link has a transmission rate of 10 Mbps and a propagation
delay of 2 milliseconds. The link is being used to transmit a file of size
5 megabytes. The file is divided into packets of 1000 bytes each. The
network link experiences a packet loss rate of 5%. If a packet is lost
during transmission, it needs to be retransmitted.
Calculate:
a) The total time taken to transmit the file, considering the packet
loss and retransmission.
b) The effective transmission rate, considering the packet loss and
retransmission. (file size in bits / total time to transmit)

Problem #04 (9 points – each requirement 3 points)

Suppose Host A wants to send a large file to Host B. The path from
Host A to Host B has three links of rates R1=500 kbps, R2=2 Mbps, and
R3=1 Mbps.

a. Assuming no other traffic in the network, what is the throughput for
the file transfer?
b. Suppose the file is 4 million bytes. Dividing the file size by the
throughput, roughly how long will it take to transfer the file to Host
B?
c. Repeat (a) and (b), but now with R reduced to 100 kbps.
