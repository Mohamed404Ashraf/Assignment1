1- Guided media refers to communication channels with physical cables that guide signals, such as coaxial cables or fiber optics. Unguided media, on the other hand, are wireless channels that don't rely on physical cables, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Guided media typically offer faster and more reliable data transmission, but they are less flexible and can be expensive to install. Unguided media provide more flexibility and mobility but may have lower speeds and can be susceptible to interference. Examples of guided media include coaxial cables and fiber optics, while examples of unguided media include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

2- Two popular wireless Internet access technologies are Wi-Fi and 5G. Wi-Fi is commonly used for local wireless networking within homes and businesses. 5G is a cellular network technology that offers high-speed wireless Internet access over a larger area. 5G generally provides faster speeds and lower latency compared to Wi-Fi, but its coverage is not as widespread as Wi-Fi.

3- Mobile access networks can have lower reliability than other access networks due to factors like signal interference, network congestion, and handovers between different cell towers. Mobile devices constantly switch between towers, which can lead to dropped calls or data interruptions. Additionally, mobile networks are more susceptible to environmental factors, such as buildings and obstacles blocking signals.

4- Coaxial cable has limitations for network use, including limited bandwidth and susceptibility to interference. Coaxial cable is capable of transmitting data but has lower bandwidth compared to fiber optics, which limits its data capacity. It is also vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and signal loss over long distances.

5- The primary purpose of packet switching devices is to forward data packets from the source to the destination. Switches operate at the data link layer and are used in local area networks to forward data frames based on MAC addresses. Routers operate at the network layer and make routing decisions based on IP addresses, allowing them to connect different networks and determine the optimal path for packet delivery.

6- Long queuing times in packet switching devices can result from factors like network congestion, high traffic volume, or inefficient routing. When the device's buffer is full, packets are queued, and if this queuing time becomes too long, it can lead to packet loss. Congestion in the network, slow processing, or inefficient traffic prioritization can all contribute to long queuing times.

7- The main advantage of packet switching over circuit switching is efficiency and flexibility. In packet switching, data is divided into packets and sent separately, allowing multiple data streams to share the same network infrastructure. This makes better use of available bandwidth and is more adaptable to varying data traffic. In contrast, circuit switching dedicates a fixed path for the entire duration of a call, which is less efficient and not as adaptable to different data types and usage patterns.

Q2
a)Here is the given information that is given in our problem:
->File Size: The file size is 10,000 kilobits.

->Transmission Rate: 1 Mbps 
->Propagation Delay: 10 milliseconds
->Packet Size: 1 kilobit each

Acknowledgment (ACK) Packets: In part (b), it's mentioned that the ACK packet is 100 bits

Transmission time per packet = Packet size / Transmission rate = 1000 / 1*10^6 = 1*10^-3 s
#Number of packets = File Size/ Packet Size = (10000 * 10*3) / 1* 10*3 = 10000 packet

Total transmission time for file =
Transmission time per packet * # of packets= 1* 10^-3 * 10,000 =10s

Total time taken to transmit the whole file = Transmission time + propagation delay
 10  + 10*10*-3 = 10.01 seconds

(b)

Transmission the per packet = 1 millisecond.
ACK packet size = 100 bits
ACK transmission time for one ACK = ACK packet size / Transmission rate = 100  / 10*10^6 = 0.00001 s
Total time for all ACK = (0.00001 + 10*10^-3 )*10000 = 100.1 s
We calculated it as it is packet by packet

Time for Every packet = Packet size / Transimition rate =  1*10^3 / 1*10^6 =0.001s
Total Time for packeets = (0.001+0.01)*10000= 110 second

Total time transfer for the file = 
Total time = 101 + 110 =211
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3
Here is the given information that is given in our problem:
Transmission Rate -> The network link has a transmission rate of 10 Mbps
Propagation Delay -> The propagation delay for the link is 2 milliseconds
File Size -> The file size is 5 megabytes
Packet Size -> The file is divided into packets where each of size 1000 bytes
Packet Loss Rate -> The network link experiences a packet loss rate of 5%
Note:If a packet is lost during transmission, it needs to be retransmitted.

a)
->Number of packets = File size / Packet size = 5*10^6 / 1000 = 5000 packet

->Transmission time per packet = Packet size / Transmission rate = 1000 *8 / (10*10^6) 'Converting  from byte to bit'
= 0.0008 s

To calculate the total transmition time we need to calculate the number of retransmissions so 

# of retransmissions =  5000 packet * 0.05 (Packet loss rate) = 250 

Total transmission time = (Transmission time for a packet + propagation
delay) * (# of packets + # of retransmissions)
Total transmission time  = (0.0008 + 2*10^-3) * 5250  = 11.025 = 14.7s

(b) Effective transmission rate:

Effective transmission rate = File size  / Total time = 5 * 8 * 10^6 / 14.7 = 272*10^5

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4
a) 
the throughput is limited by the link with rate R1, which is 500 kbps.

So,the throughput for the file transfer is 500 kbps.

b) 
File size in bits = 4,000,000 bytes * 8  = 32,000,000 bits

Transfer time = File size / Throughput = 32,000,000  / 500,000 = 64 s

->approximately 64 seconds to transfer to Host B our file

c) 
The throughput is now limited by the link with rate R, which is 100 kbps.

So, the throughput for the file transfer is 100 kbps.

size of the file in bits = 4,000,000  * 8 = 32,000,000

Transfer time = File size / Throughput = 32,000,000  / 100,000 = 320s
